## Introduction
This repository contains a course project for <b>Coursera Practical Machine Learning</b> course.
There are 2 files: MachineLearning_CourseProj.Rmd and MachineLearning_CourseProj.html.
The first file is R-markdown file with text and R code. The HTML is a compilation of the R-Markdown made by Knitr.
The building of the prediction model is a complex, time and resource consuming process.
If you decide it to try on your machine please be sure that you have enough RAM and CPU power.
On my Windows 7, 64 bit with 8 GB RAM and Intel Core i5 processor it took about 45 minutes to compile the HTML file.

If you cannot see the HTML file from GIT properly, please download it and open locally.
